Movement Minigame
Apex inspired terrain induced movement mechanism
Potentially with procedural level generation 

Speed boost is gained from landing consecutive skill movements

Good example would be Lucio
He gets more speed the more wall jumps he does without touching the ground

Sliding type movement seems easier on side scroller
If I want to do top down I might have to come up with a different mechanic

#### Swinging like Spiderman but it's horizontal 
Your hook can attach to objects and the centripetal force will accelerate you

#### Sliding Fancy Pants and wall kick combination
Side view with Fancy Pants movement, sliding, and wall kick
